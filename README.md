greta.live
==========

A prototype package for live visualisation of statistical inference for greta models.

For example, we're hoping to add live plotting of an MCMC trace whilst the algorithm is running.

There's nothing here yet though.

Installation
------------

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("goldingn/greta.live")
```
